# DataJournalismUvA
This is my Final Project for the Data Journalism course at University of Amsterdam. 
In it, I put into practice what we have learned about Python over 6 weeks of class in Autumn 2022.
My journalistic project focuses on **the role of finance in the arms business**.

I hope you find it interesting!
